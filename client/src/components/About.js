        The purpose of Food Saver is to decrease the amount of food waste that occurs from
making excess food waste. The good quality food that restruants throw out at the end of 
the day increases the food print. The food print looks at the greenhouse gas emissions produced by growing, rearing, farming, processing, transporting, storing, cooking,
disposing of the food you eat.

        The Food-Saver is a platform to be utilized as a form of donating the excess foods made in restruants, which
will be donated to organizations that distribute the donated food. The platform allows donors
to identify the food that can be available to be picked up by the organizations or individulas who are in need of the food.
